- Create training data and testing data somehow

Questions for TA:
- Is it reasonable to try converting a .mbox file to CSV manually for TP3?
- Should I store emails under a class? Does that make more sense than a panda dataframe?
- Does it make sense to ask for already labeled data in different CSV export as a feature? Does that defeat the point? Just curious how I should go about getting training data.
- I'm mostly interested in taking data without any pre-determined labels and clustering them
- Would it be reasonable to give any suggestions on filters by finding commonalities in the data for different emails in the same cluster?

- To gauge sentiment analysis take lists of good words and bad words found online
- For labels, make them more generalâ€”use synonyms to link together as many emails as possible. You can always make it more specific.
- To load data, import 'load data' inside a function so it won't run on anything until the person has uploaded their file.
